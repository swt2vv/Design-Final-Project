    "  In his description of the dataset it says that it \"provides a comprehensive, state-level view of the key factors influencing electric vehicle (EV) adoption across the United States.\" I wanted to use this dataset specifically because I wanted to explore Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption within the USA and understand the different possible factors that contributes to flucuating rates including, but not limited to location, government incentives, political association, and accessability to charging stations. \n",

The columns that I used in my analysis were collected by the following organizations: US Census Bureau (socioeconomic indicator columns), and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) (EV registrations), Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC) (charging stations and incentives), Energy Information Administration (EIA) (electricity prices). All of these sources are government run agencies, so the data is collected, refined, and distributed by a verifed source. \n",
